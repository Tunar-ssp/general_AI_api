# AI API Management System - Detailed ToDo List

## Overview
This document provides a step-by-step guide to creating an automated AI API management system using **Python (FastAPI)**. The system will efficiently handle API request limits, distribute requests among multiple APIs, and ensure seamless operation without user intervention.

The primary APIs that will be managed in this system:
1. **Gemini 2.0 Flash**
2. **Deepseek** (version unknown)
3. **Olama** (version unknown)

---

## Objectives
1. **Automate API Selection & Routing:** Dynamically choose an API based on availability and request limits.
2. **Rate Limiting & Request Distribution:** Ensure APIs are not overloaded and switch APIs when limits are reached.
3. **Caching & Response Optimization:** Store common queries to reduce unnecessary API calls.
4. **Error Handling & Failover:** Retry requests with alternative APIs if one fails.
5. **Logging & Monitoring:** Track API usage, errors, and performance.
6. **Database Management:** Store API keys and request history securely.
7. **Environment Configuration:** Enable easy addition of new APIs via `.env`.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### 1. **Project Setup**
- Initialize a backend server using **FastAPI**.
- Install required dependencies: `pip install fastapi uvicorn requests redis pymongo python-dotenv`.
- Configure `.env` for API keys, limits, and endpoint URLs.
- Set up database:
  - **PostgreSQL** for structured API tracking and logging.
  - **Redis** for caching frequently used responses.
- Implement a basic API gateway structure using FastAPI routers.

### 2. **API Request Handling**
- Create a FastAPI router that:
  - Receives requests from users.
  - Checks API availability and selects the best option.
  - Forwards requests to the chosen API using `requests` library.
- Implement dynamic API key selection from `.env`.
- Develop a mechanism to automatically switch APIs upon reaching limits.

### 3. **Rate Limiting & Load Balancing**
- Implement request counting per API using Redis.
- Apply request balancing to distribute load across APIs:
  - Check request quotas per minute/hour/day.
  - Rotate between APIs based on availability.
  - Implement adaptive throttling to prevent hitting limits too fast.
- Introduce request queuing for overflow handling.

### 4. **Caching & Performance Optimization**
- Use Redis to cache frequently requested responses.
- Optimize request payloads to reduce data size and improve speed.
- Implement a cache expiration policy to balance storage and accuracy.
- Reduce duplicate requests by checking cached responses before making a new API call.

### 5. **Error Handling & Failover Mechanism**
- Detect API failures and retry with a different API.
- Implement exponential backoff for retries.
- Log failed requests with timestamps and error messages.
- Set up a fallback API in case all primary APIs fail.

### 6. **Logging & Monitoring**
- Record API requests, responses, and errors in the database.
- Track API usage statistics per service.
- Generate analytics on API performance and failure rates.
- Implement a real-time monitoring dashboard (optional) using FastAPI and a frontend library (React or Vue).

### 7. **Security & Environment Configuration**
- Store API keys securely using environment variables.
- Implement access controls to restrict unauthorized usage.
- Allow dynamic API addition via `.env` file.
- Set up API key rotation mechanisms to handle expired or revoked keys.

## Expected Output
- Fully automated API management system built with **Python (FastAPI)** handling **Gemini 2.0 Flash, Deepseek, and Olama**.
- Intelligent request distribution across available APIs.
- Optimized caching to minimize API calls and maximize efficiency
